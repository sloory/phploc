# PHPLOC

`phploc` is a tool for quickly measuring the size and analyzing the structure of a PHP project.

## Installation

There are three supported ways of installing PHPLOC.

You can use the [PEAR Installer](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/guide.users.commandline.cli.php) or [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to download and install PHPLOC as well as its dependencies. You can also download a [PHP Archive (PHAR)](http://php.net/phar) of PHPLOC that has all required (as well as some optional) dependencies of PHPLOC bundled in a single file.

### PEAR Installer

The following two commands (which you may have to run as `root`) are all that is required to install PHPLOC using the PEAR Installer:

    pear config-set auto_discover 1
    pear install pear.phpunit.de/phploc

### Composer

To add PHPLOC as a local, per-project dependency to your project, simply add a dependency on `phploc/phploc` to your project's `composer.json` file. Here is a minimal example of a `composer.json` file that just defines a development-time dependency on PHPLOC 2.0:

    {
        "require-dev": {
            "phploc/phploc": "2.0.*"
        }
    }

### PHP Archive (PHAR)

    wget http://pear.phpunit.de/get/phploc.phar
    chmod +x phploc.phar
